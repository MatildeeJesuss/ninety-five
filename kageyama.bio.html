                <li>Famously known since middle school as "The King of the Court" because of his arrogant way of 
                leading the game and talking to his teammates as a setter, because of how he was always considered 
                a progidy and no one at that age could live up to his expectations and capabilities. He has 
                improved a lot since he started playing in karasuno.</li>
